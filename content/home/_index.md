# Save Our Water. Stop the Pit.

Welcome to the grassroots campaign to protect the Alliston Aquifer — known for some of the purest water in the world — from ongoing gravel pit expansion.

## What’s at Stake

- The Alliston Aquifer is a globally significant groundwater source
- Expansion of the Teedon Pit threatens its integrity
- Community members rely on “The Source” in Elmvale for clean, free water

**Join us to protect it.**
